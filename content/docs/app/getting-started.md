# Getting Started
Welcome to the Next.js documentation!
This **Getting Started** section will help you create your first Next.js app and learn the core features you'll use in every project.
## Pre-requisite knowledge
Our documentation assumes some familiarity with web development. Before getting started, it'll help if you're comfortable with:
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * JavaScript
  * React


If you're new to React or need a refresher, we recommend starting with our React Foundations course, and the Next.js Foundations course that has you building an application as you learn.
